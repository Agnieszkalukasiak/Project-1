ANIMAL WITHIN
The Animal Within official website is dedicated to promoting the film and providing comprehensive information to fans and potential viewers. The site is designed to be the primary online destination for everything related to the movie, from release details to exclusive content and community engagement.

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

- Featured on all five pages, the responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Synopsis, Trailer, Gallery, and PR inquiries, and is identical on each page to make navigation easy.

- This navigation bar makes it easy to navigate from page to page without having to use the "back" button.

### The landing page 

 - The landing page includes a poster, the title, and a credit list. It also includes information about the "selected cinema release" and a button to allow the user to watch the trailer without having to go through the trouble of looking for it on the navigation bar, prompting a more instinctual navigation.

- This section introduces Animal Within with an eye-catching poster to capture users attention and prompts the user to watch the trailer.

### Pr Inquiries

-  The press inquiry page provides a form where any press inquiries can be submitted by the user.

- This form allows media, distributors, and other interested parties to request press materials, interviews, and more information about the film. Once the inquiry is submitted, the relevant PR team will respond via email. This makes it easy for the media to contact the PR agents for the film and get the information and materials they need.

### Features Left to Implement

- Adding another official trailer.
Adding a form where the user can enter their location to find out which cinemas in their city are playing the film and when.

### Testing

The webpage for Animal Within works on various devices and screen sizes.
There are initial problems with the size of the official posters, which do not work well for the web. This will be addressed by designing a new poster specifically for the web, so it can be easily rescaled to various screen sizes and devices.
Currently, the form on the press inquiry page doesn’t send inquiries, as there is no backend for this page yet. This will be addressed at a later stage.
The social media links are currently linked to my private accounts or just to the platform itself (if I don’t have an account on that platform). This is just to illustrate that the links work. Since the movie’s social media accounts are not yet properly set up, this will need to be addressed at a later stage.
